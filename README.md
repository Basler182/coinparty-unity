Agencies and organizations post what they need. Volunteers search for opportunities posted by agencies and organizations by name, location, cause, interest, job or skill. Currency is distributed by time from check-in to check-out. Currency is accounted for through the app mining meter at a set rate. Leaderboards are posted on App and Website, while users and agencies can share on social media platforms. Sharing receives additional currency distributions. Account set up and referrals award currency. Users must be verified for additional incentives. Anonymous users mine at a higher rate to offset the social media incentive, we do not want to penalize anonymous volunteers.
